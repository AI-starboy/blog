To me, I started to hear that Stephen Curry was a thing after they beat Cavs led by Lebron James in 2015. However, during then, I was indulged myself in Dota2 and after Yao retired and the hype finale to see Dirk Nowitzki beat the most talented team Miami Heat, I had lost my interest in NBA for the most part reason that I didn't like superstars grouped together to make the game less fair for other teams. So for those years during 2012-14, I barely watched NBA and just skimmed over monthly top 10 highlights. The athleticism and talents from the dominant Miami Heat didn't bring beauty of the basketball to me.

But for now, I'm more open to accept it's just part of the game and the NBA league especially after witnessing the symptom of overwhelming superstars grouping trend these years. As a basketball player, your recognition is mostly relied on how many rings you can get which helps you win the trash talk on the court if you know what I mean. Although I understand it, I still appreciate building a successful team from bottom to top more cuz it takes more patience and courage. When I started to be amazed by this Golden States Warriors team in 2015 and joke with friends about Andre steals the MVP from Steph, I had no idea about how this team was formed.

This documentary unveiled the mysterious roadmap of the warriors becomes a champion to me. The first surprise was actually not from the players or the coach while from the business and management side. The owners of GS Warriors showed their ambition and acute decisions to select Steph as the base and build a team around him. Every pick and trades made for the following seasons were essential. They picked Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green(the gem in the second round draft), got Andrew Bogut, David Lee and Andre Iguodala. And after a fairly acceptable season, they fired the head coach and chose Steve Kerr who hadn't even coached an NBA game. Altough Steve was a successful player with five rings and being an assistant coach for Gregg Popovich for a while, the coach replacement was still considered to be a bold move.

The second impression is that the warriors soared after the season started and made a long lasting wining streak and Draymond said they felt wierd when they got caught in a game that they were about to lose. And the team knew there was something or I say chemistry on the court simply because it worked. I can feel a winner sensation that is different from normal team. When you take failure as an uncomfortable thing, you will strive to be better.

The third impression is that this team is epic proof of teamwork and trust will outplay the best individual. Honestly, the warriors were quite young and none of the players had ever been to the champion final before. Needless to say that they were facing Lebron James, it took quite a few matches for Steph Curry to get his rhythm in the game. So what could help them grow in this short but critical time frame? Besides the guidance, tactics and encouragement from coach Steve Kerr, it's from the trust. There is always someone picking his bothers when they are down. It's you that strive to make every play, every ball possession, every defense worthy or who else will add value to this champion. It's your hard work that makes the success precious, tasty and memorable. You gotta believe and do it.
